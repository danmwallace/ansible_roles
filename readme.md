# Ansible Roles for Ubuntu and Fedora

## What you will find here

This is my collection of roles for Ubuntu and Fedora. Most of them are for the server versions, but I will also be adding roles intended for use with workstations.

## Server Management Roles

The following roles can be used for managing Ubuntu and Fedora Servers. They have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04+ LTS and Fedora 41 (Server + IoT).

### Common Roles

* [ansible_common](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_common) : Configures a "common" baseline configuration on the machine. Intended use is for packages that need to be installed on each server. Also adds user accounts.
* [ansible_common_cockpit](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_common_cockpit) : Configures Cockpit, to allow for administrative tasks through a web interface. Must be used with one of the SSL roles below, as it will copy the certificate generated by those and copy it for use by Cockpit.
* [ansible_ssl_cloudflare](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_ssl_cloudflare) : Configures an SSL certificate via `certbot`, using `inventory_hostname` as the FQDN. Simply add your API key to a vault and run it in a playbook against the target host.
* [ansible_ssl_azuredns](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_ssl_azuredns) : Configures an SSL certificate via certbot, using AzureDNS.

### Docker Roles
These roles are used to deploy applications I use in my lab environment via Docker. They are broken into (2) categories - pre-requisites and application roles.

#### Pre-requisites for Applications

The following must be used in playbooks along with the application roles. 
* [ansible_docker](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker) : Common role to set up the baseline pre-requisites for Docker on Ubuntu and Fedora.
* [ansible_docker_traefik](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_traefik) : Deploys Traefik. **All of the following roles are intended to be proxied via Traefik.**

#### Applications

* [ansible_docker_arcane](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_arcane) : Deploys Arcane, a Modern Docker Management system(https://github.com/getarcaneapp/arcane)
* [ansible_docker_adguard](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_adguard) : Deploys AdGuard, a DNS ad filtering service, and a decently easy DNS server to set up in a pinch. 
* [ansible_docker_baserow](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_baserow) : Deploys Baserow, a no-code database tool. but 
* [ansible_docker_homepage](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_homepage) : Deploys the [Homepage application](https://gethomepage.dev)
* [ansible_docker_it_tools](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_it_tools) : Deploys [IT Tools](https://github.com/CorentinTh/it-tools)
* [ansible_docker_n8n](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_n8n) : Deploys [N8N](https://n8n.io/), an AI workflow & automation builder.
* [ansible_docker_unifi](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_unifi) : Deploys a Unifi controller, based on LinuxServer.io's excellent work.
* [ansible_docker_semaphore](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_semaphore) : Deploys a (formerly Ansible) Semaphore, a web-based application for running and managing tasks with Ansible. Similar to Ansible Tower by Red Hat.
* [ansible_docker_grafana](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_docker_grafana) : Deploys Grafana, a useful monitoring application

#### Azure

* [ansible_azure_arc](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_azure_arc) : Install Azure Arc on virtual machines for monitoring, update management, etc.

## Workstation Management Roles

### Desktop Environments

* [ansible_clank_desktop](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_clank_desktop) : Deploy an AI-powered desktop environment, based on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, with plans to support Fedora in the near future.
* [ansible_fedora_hyprland](https://github.com/danmwallace/ansible_fedora_hyprland) : Installs and configures hyprland. Recommend to use Fedora server as the base for minimalism.

## Using these roles in your environment

To use these roles, set up a `requirements.yml` file in the `root` directory of your Ansible project, or, within the `roles/` folder.

Then, in that file, add the repositories of the roles you wish to use:
```
- src: git@github.com:danmwallace/ansible_common.git
  version: main
  name: ansible_common
```
